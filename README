This is a collection of a few small projects using the Moby Project lexical collection, mostly for fun and practice in Rust. The Moby Project is hosted at http://digital.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=3201 with additional files on archive.org (https://archive.org/details/mobypartofspeech03203gut, as well as others)

There is a JSON file which contains all mobyproject words and their parts of speech. There is also a sample program that parses this file and returns a random adjective, to randomly generate the name of a theoretical Spice Girl. 

There are also plans for a Shakesperean insult generator which pulls words based on their parts of speech in a given order to create an insult.
